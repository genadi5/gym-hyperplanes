1. Classification --> in progress --> Done
2. Export to specific file --> Done
3. Variables should be greater than their minimum and not greater than 0 --> Done
4. Multi-threading on execution --> in progress --> Done
5. If we have two areas (one in another) have same boundary than we have to do something with this --> Not relevant
7. Optimization of reward calculation --> Done

6. Use SARSA instead DQN ????
8. Full loop:
    a. Train some reliable classification model
    b. get train and build hyperplane system with high prediction score
    c. get instances and propose change to get them to some class
    d. Check proposed changes in models from a.
9. Maybe change reward evaluation - for example amount of grouped (by sufficient accuracy) but not including singles
10. Further performance optimization - find where we loose
11.
