1. Classification --> in progress --> Done
2. Export to specific file --> Done
3. Variables should be greater than their minimum and not greater than 0 --> Done
4. Multi-threading on execution --> in progress --> Done
5. If we have two areas (one in another) have same boundary than we have to do something with this --> Not relevant
7. Optimization of reward calculation --> Done
13. which part of actions should be movement of hyperplane from all the movements --> Done
8. Full loop: --> Done
    a. Train some reliable classification model
    b. get train and build hyperplane system with high prediction score
    c. get instances and propose change to get them to some class
    d. Check proposed changes in models from a.
16. Probabilities - not only probability but also the amount of instances --> Done
6. KERAS DQN --> Done
9. Maybe change reward evaluation - for example amount of grouped/isolated (by sufficient accuracy)
but not including singles --> Done
15. Feature - Set of points from the nearest class area --> Done
19. Clean up project --> Done
10. Further performance optimization - find where we loose --> Done
12. ??? Limit minimum of instances in area from below, meaning that 1 instance (for example)
in area is not acceptable --> Not Relevant
18. If no changes on execution - split the area --> Done
19. Configure episode steps in properties file --> Done
11. Documentation --> In Progress
17. Feature - Probability of class to use - when to use it in selection of the nearest class
18. What is this var > 0 for ?
